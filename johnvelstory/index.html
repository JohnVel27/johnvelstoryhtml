        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is John Vel, and I was born in Mandaue, Cebu. Ever since I was a kid, I've always been fond of using computers because I enjoy playing games on them, such as League of Legends, Crossfire, and many more. One thing I can say about my personality is that I'm quick to engage with other people, and I really enjoy interacting with them, especially if I can learn something from them.</p>
        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>As a child, I had a bit of magic in me. We frequently moved houses because when I was living in Cebu, our house was near a canal, and the unpleasant smell affected my health. Since I often suffered from asthma there, I moved in with my grandparents because their home was surrounded by abundant trees and was closer to the sea, where I could swim to help improve my asthma. My father used to work in Cebu, but he resigned and moved to Manila. Consequently, we also moved to join him in Manila. That's where I studied, from elementary to college, in Cavite.</p>
        <h2>Technology and Gaming</h2>
        <p>In the bustling city of Mandaue, Cebu, where the streets hummed with the energy of everyday life, I spent my formative years navigating the intricate maze of urban existence. From the earliest days of my childhood, I was drawn to the captivating allure of technology. It began innocently enough, with my first encounter with a computer—a bulky, antiquated machine that sparked a flame of curiosity within me.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Looking back on my journey, I realized that life is a tapestry of moments, each one weaving together to form the fabric of our existence. From the humble beginnings in Mandaue to the bustling streets of Manila, every chapter had contributed to my growth and evolution as a person. And as I looked towards the future, I did so with optimism and excitement, eager to see where the road ahead would take me. In the end, it wasn't just about the destinations we reached or the goals we achieved, but the journey itself—the lessons learned, the friendships forged, and the experiences that shaped us along the way.</p>
        <p>And as I set out to write the next chapter of my story, I did so with a sense of purpose and determination, ready to embrace whatever challenges and adventures lay ahead.</p>
